for compiling use 'tsc -p tsconfig.json' in terminal instead of ctrl+shift+b or instead of 'tsc*.ts'

!-----BETTER WAY------!
- initialize tsc and create tsconfig.json by typing the tsc --init command in the terminal
- if have public and src folders, specify those as rootDir and outDir in the tsconfig.json
- compile all ts files by typing tsc in the terminal, run node with file name
- for auto compilation type tsc -w in the terminal
